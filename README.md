# ssbc grants proposals process

ssbc grants are a way we are currently trialing to fund ssb
development. each month, up to 4 grants are funded from
a submitted by community members.

This git repo was created to hold the various documentation
we have of the process.

The grant process was originally outlined in [grants.md](./grants.md),
see [links to relavant ssb threads](./links.md) of announcements,
discussions, decision threads, and proposals (funded or not)

[template.md](./template.md) is a reminder of the information
that needs to go in each monthly decision thread. It's source
can be copied into a new thread to start the discussion for
that month.

[roles.md](./roles.md) is a description of the various roles
in the grants process. If you are reading this, you are already
playing a role!

This process will likely evolve and changes can be made by creating
pull requests to this repo and having discussions on ssb.
